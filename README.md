# Dynamic-Routing-Configuration

Implement dynamic routing using the Routing Information Protocol
(RIP) to exchange routing information between devices. 
Configure RIP on Cisco 2911 RouterA and Cisco 2911 RouterB.
Activate a loopback interface on RouterA to simulate a subnet for RIP advertisement.
Indicate the directly connected networks participating in the RIP process. 
Verified routing table entries indicating routes learned via RIP.
