- Dynamic routing involves the exchange of routing information between devices using a routing protocol.
- Make sure the following devices are powered on
	- Device A (Router 1)
	- Device B (Router 2)
	- Device C (Router 3)

- Configuring Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

- We will first activate a loopback interface that has been preconfigured on Device A
	- This will simulate a subnet that will be advertised by RIP
- The loopback 0 interface has an IP address of [IP address] and this is in the [subnet] subnet
- Type: configure terminal
- Type: interface loopback 0
- Type: no shutdown
- Type: exit
- Enable the RIP protocol
	- Type: router rip
	- RIP has now been enabled on Device A (prompt changes to Device A(config-router)#
- We need to indicate to the router which directly connected networks will participate in the RIP process
- Type: network [network 1]
- Type: network [network 2]
- Type: network [network 3]
- Type: exit
- Type: exit
- These three networks will be advertised out of all its active interfaces
	- The router is saying that any other router that wants to get to these network destinations should send their packets to it
- We will configure the RIP protocol on Device B
- Connect to Device B
- Type: configure terminal
- Type: router rip
	- RIP is now enabled
- Type: network [network 1]
- Type: network [network 2]
- Type: exit
- Type: exit
- Type: show ip route
	- A new entry in the routing table appears with the R code indicating that the route was learned via the RIP protocol
	- The destination network is that of the loopback 0 interface on Device A
	- Also note that in order to reach this new network of [subnet], there are two possible routes:
		- Via [next hop 1]
		- Via [next hop 2]
	- These are the interfaces of Device A
- Test to make sure this newly added route is properly functioning
- Type: ping [IP address]
	- The ping is successful
